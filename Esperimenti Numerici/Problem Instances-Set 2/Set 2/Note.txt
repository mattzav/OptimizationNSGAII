There are instances for Set 2(a) from Salehipour et al (2011) and Set 2(b) from Tuzun and Burke (1999) and also from Prins et al (2006).

The order of the files are the same as the order of the instances appearing in the tables in the paper.

Files contain the coordinates of each demand location (and depot) for problem instance Y in problem setup X.
The first and last coordinates represent the depot location.

There are also files that contain the flight range limits of the drones. These ranges have been calculated for 25% and 50% coverage percentages. For example for instances from Prins  et al. (2006) with 50 customers “Flight_25_Percent50.txt” means 25% coverage percentage. 50 denotes the number of customers.
