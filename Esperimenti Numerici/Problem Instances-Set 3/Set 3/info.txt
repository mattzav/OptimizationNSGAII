There are fifteen problem instances: five instances for each Area.

For each problem instance, there are two files:

1- File “Ax_y_Dist_Matrix.csv” gives the real distance between each pair of nodes in kilometers. x denotes area number and y denotes the instance number for that area.
2- File “Ax_y_Lat_Long.csv” gives the latitude and longitude of each demand location (and depot) for problem instance y in Area x.

To obtain travel times, one can divide distance by the vehicle speed.
The first node in all files represent the depot
